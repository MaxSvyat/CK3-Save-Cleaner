Tired of your Crusader Kings 3 saves becoming bloated and slow after centuries of gameplay? This tool helps you clean your save files by removing obsolete and non-essential data, reducing file size, and potentially improving performance and stability, especially in the late game.

Key Features:
-Targeted Cleaning: Choose what to remove from 12 different categories, from safe cosmetic text to deep data like dead characters and dynasties.
-Risk-Level Visual Guide: Settings are color-coded (Green = Safe, Orange = Risky) based on stability impact.
-Safety First: Always create a backup of your original save before processing (highly recommended and enabled by default).
-Bilingual Interface: Full support for English and Russian.

Easy to Use: Simple "Select File -> Choose Options -> Process" workflow with tooltips for every setting.

How It Works:

Launch CK3 in debug_mode (see instructions in the program).

Use the in-game console command save YourSaveName to create an uncompressed save.

Run CK3 Save Cleaner, select your uncompressed .ck3 file.

Select the desired cleaning options (start with the green ones!).

Click "Process". Load the cleaned save in CK3 and continue your campaign.

Cleaning Options (from safest to riskiest):

Green (Generally Safe): Clear text descriptions, cultural acceptance history, house unity changes, character memories, title/artifact history, dynasty history.

Orange (Use with Caution): Clear dead characters (un/prunable), family connections to dead children, dead houses (dynn_), dead dynasties. May cause instability or crashes if used improperly.

Important Warnings:

ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR SAVES before using any save editor. The "Create backup" option does this for you.

Test your save after cleaning, especially when using orange options. Save frequently in-game afterward.

Understand the risk: Deleting game objects (like dead characters) can lead to crashes if other parts of the save reference them. The tool tries to handle related data (like family connections), but caution is advised.

Project Background:
This utility was developed as a course project at The Kovrov State Technological University named after V.A. Degtyarev, Department of Applied Mathematics and CAD Systems. It represents a practical application of programming skills to solve a real problem faced by the gaming community.
